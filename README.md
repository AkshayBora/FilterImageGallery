# React + Vite Project
# Filter Image Gallery is a dynamic and visually appealing web application built using React. This interactive gallery allows users to efficiently explore and sort through a diverse collection of images based on different categories or filters. The user-friendly interface presents a grid of thumbnail images that can be filtered using dropdown menus or buttons. Leveraging the power of React's component-based architecture, the gallery updates in real-time as users select filters, providing a seamless and responsive browsing experience.
# Behind the scenes, the application efficiently manages state and re-renders only the necessary components, optimizing performance and ensuring a smooth user interaction. As users apply filters, the gallery intelligently adjusts its display to showcase only the images that match the selected criteria, making it easy to find specific content.
